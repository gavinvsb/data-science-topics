        "- The game show set has three doors. A prize such as a car or vacation is behind one door, and the other two doors hide a valueless prize called a Zonk; in most discussions of the problem, the Zonk is a goat.\n",
        "- The contestant chooses one door. We’ll assume the contestant has no inside knowledge of which door holds the prize, so the contestant will just make a random choice.\n",
        "- The smiling host Monty Hall opens one of the other doors, always choosing one that shows a goat, and always offers the contestant a chance to switch their choice to the remaining unopened door.\n",
        "- The contestant either chooses to switch doors, or opts to stick with the first choice. Monty calls for the remaining two doors to open, and the contestant wins whatever is behind their chosen door.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s say a hypothetical contestant chooses door #2. Monty might then open door #1 and offer the chance to switch to door #3. The contestant switches to door #3, and then we see if the prize is behind #3.\n",
        "\n",
        "The puzzle is: what is the best strategy for the contestant? Does switching increase the chance of winning the car, decrease it, or make no difference?\n",
        "\n",
        "The best strategy is to make the switch. It’s possible to analyze the situation and figure this out, but instead we’ll tackle it by simulating thousands of games and measuring how often each strategy ends up winning."

Considering the same game with many more doors makes reasoning about the problem much clearer, so we’ll make the number of doors a configurable parameter of the simulation script.\n"

The programmers will need to carefully validate their code by unit-testing the simulation’s internal functions and adding checks for internal correctness. monty-hall.py does this in a small way with an assert statement that will raise an exception if the number of closed doors is not equal to $2$, which would indicate some sort of failure in the `simulate()` function’s logic or input data.
